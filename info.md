# Introduction

Huntsville, Alabama is a perfect place to host the GNU Radio Conference 2019. It has a concentration of Scientists, Engineers, and Technologists who work in a broad range of areas including NASA's Space Flight programs, Missile Defense, Genetics, and many associated disciplines. In addition, there are plenty of cultural and entertainment attractions.

There is a comprehensive guide to attractions and things to do at [Huntsville's Web Site](https://www.huntsville.org/), but the conference committee would like to make some specific recommendations for our conference.

## Conference Hotels

* The conference is taking place at the [Huntsville Marriott at the Space & Rocket Center](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/hsval-huntsville-marriott-at-the-space-and-rocket-center/). EDITME ADD A LINK OR CODE FOR THE CONFERENCE ROOM RATE. The Marriott is walking distance from the [Huntsville Space and Rocket Center](https://rocketcenter.com/), so you and your family can visit there if you want (and we recommend it).

* The overflow hotel is the [Drury Inn & Suites Huntsville at the Space & Rocket Center](https://www.druryhotels.com/locations/huntsville-al/drury-inn-and-suites-huntsville-at-the-space-and-rocket-center). While this hotel is close to the conference hotel, it is not safe to walk between the hotels due to inadequate pedestrian accomodations and the need to cross the Interstate. The drive time between hotels is about 5-10 minutes.

* Camping is available at the [Monte Sano state park](https://www.alapark.com/campground). This is a lovely campground with pull-through, back-in, and tent camping spaces. There are also cabins available for rental in the park. The drive from the park to the conference hotel is 20-40 minutes, depending on traffic.
